## 🎯 The Problem

You open your Downloads folder 📂: **3,247 files**. **89GB used** 💾. 

Somewhere in there are the large video files 🎥 eating your storage, but finding them means **15 minutes of scrolling** ⏳. 

Manually sorting? **2+ hours** 😵‍💫 of dragging 🖱️, dropping 📥, and second-guessing 🤔.

**This is a common productivity drain across organizations:**
- IT teams waste hours on storage cleanup
- Developers lose time searching for large files
- Project folders become unmanageable
- Critical disk space issues go unnoticed until it's too late

## ✨ The Solution

⚡ **This script solves it in ~4 seconds.**

✅ **What it does:**
- 📦 Large files are automatically organized into size-based folders
- 📁 Small files stay exactly where they are (no unnecessary moves)
- 📝 Every action is logged for a complete audit trail
- 🔄 Includes rollback capability via backup manifests
- 🔍 Preview mode lets you see changes before they happen

## 📊 Impact & Performance

### ⏱️ Before vs After

|                    | ❌ Before (Manual)                         | ✅ After (Automated)                  |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| ⏳ **Time Required**    | ~2 hours for 3,000+ files                 | **~4 seconds**                        |
| 🧠 **Effort**           | High cognitive load, tedious              | **One command**                       |
| ⚠️ **Error Risk**       | Human error, missed files                 | **100% accurate**                     |
| 🔍 **Visibility**       | Manual inspection, guesswork              | **Instant categorization**            |
| 📝 **Audit Trail**      | None                                      | **Full logging**                      |
| 💰 **Cost Impact**      | Developer time burned on cleanup          | **Automated, repeatable**             |
| ☕ **Developer Time**   | Wasted on manual tasks                    | **Available for value-add work**      |

## 🛠️ About The Tool

This tool automatically categorizes and organizes files in **any folder** based on configurable size thresholds:

**Default Organization:**
- **Files ≥ 1GB** → `above 1GB` folder
- **Files 1MB-1GB** → `1MB-1GB` folder
- **Files < 1MB** → Remain in original location (untouched)

> All thresholds are fully customizable to meet your team's needs.
